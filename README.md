# day-scheduler


## Task
I created a Day-Planner , by using HTML, CSS and JS. I used various functions and global variables to make the quiz functional. I also used EventListeners to activate some functions by a click of a button. 

I used some of my old work and these websites for more information:

 I also had help from my friend Rogelio Sandoval.
